\Section{Introduction}
In this paper, we are concerned with the approximate controllability for a fractional differential equation with nonlocal initial conditions of the form
\begin{equation}\label{e1.1}
\left\{\begin{aligned}
&D^\alpha x(t) = Ax(t)+J_t^{1-\alpha}[f(t,x(t))+Bu(t)] ,\quad 0< t\leq b,\\
&x(0)=x_0-g(x),
\end{aligned}
\right.\tag{0.1}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $D^\alpha$ is the Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha$ with $0<\alpha< 1$, \,$A:D(A)\subset X\rightarrow X$ is the infinitesimal
generator of a resolvent $S_\alpha(t), t\geq 0$, $B:U\rightarrow X$ is a bounded linear operator, $u\in L^2([0,b],U)$, $X$
and $U$ are two real Hilbert spaces, $J_t^{1-\alpha}h$ denotes the $1-\alpha$ order fractional integral of $h\in L^1([0,b],X)$,
and $f,g$ are appropriate continuous functions to be specified later.

The controllable problem has attracted a lot of  mathematicians and engineers, since it plays a key role in control theory and engineering and has very important applications in these fields. Many contributions on exact and approximate controllability have been made in recent years. We refer the reader to the recent papers~\cite{[1],[2],[3]} and references therein. Many authors discuss the approximate controllability when the linear closed operator generates a classical semigroup. However, there are few articles to study the fractional control system~\eqref{e1.1} governed by a linear operator which generates a resolvent. The main difficulty is that the resolvent does not have the property of semigroups, even the continuity in the uniform operator topology. Fortunately, we have proven the continuity of the resolvent in the uniform operator topology and given the characterization of compactness for resolvents in the case of an analytic resolvent. For more details, we refer the readers to the recent paper~\cite{[4]} by Fan.

In Section~\ref{sec2}, we obtain the existence results for  the nonlocal fractional control system.

\Section{Preliminaries}

\begin{definition}[\supercite{[2]}]\label{def1}
The fractional order integral of the
function $f\in L^1([0,b],X)$ of order $\alpha>0$ is defined by
$$J_t^{\alpha}f(t)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t(t-s)^{\alpha-1}f(s)\mathrm{d}s,$$
where $\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}[{(\cite[Theorem~2]{[5]})}]\label{lemma1}
Suppose that $u$ is the optimal control of (1.3). Then
$$u(t)=B^*S_\alpha^*(b-t)R(\lambda,\Lambda_b)p(x(\,\cdot\,)), \quad t\in [0,b]$$
with
$$p(x(\,\cdot\,))=x_b-S_\alpha(b)[x_0-g(x)]-\int_0^bS_\alpha(b-s)f(s,x(s))\mathrm{d}s.$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{Proof}
The proof is similar to that of \cite[Lemma 2.9]{[4]}, so we omit it.
\end{Proof}

According to Lemma~\ref{lemma1}, for every $\lambda>0$ and $x_b\in X$, we construct the following integral system:
\begin{equation}\label{e2.9}
\left\{\begin{aligned}
&x(t)=S_\alpha(t)[x_0-g(x)]+\int_0^tS_\alpha(t-s)[f(s,x(s))+Bu(s)]\mathrm{d}s,\quad 0\leq t\leq b,\\
&u(t)=B^*S_\alpha^*(b-t)R(\lambda,\Lambda_b)p(x(\,\cdot\,)),\\
&p(x(\,\cdot\,))=x_b-S_\alpha(b)[x_0-g(x)]-\int_0^bS_\alpha(b-s)f(s,x(s))\mathrm{d}s.
\end{aligned}
\right.\tag{1.4}
\end{equation}

\Section{Existence Results} \label{sec2}

\begin{remark}
It is easy to see that the condition (H3) is weaker than the
compactness and convexity of $g$. The same hypothesis can be seen
from [4, 6, 29], where the authors considered the existence of
mild solutions for semilinear nonlocal problems of integer order when $A$ generates a
$C_0$-semigroup. After the proof of our main results, we give some special types of nonlocal
item $g$ which is neither Lipschitz nor compact, but satisfies the
condition (H3) in the next corollaries.
\end{remark}

Now, we can prove the first main result in this paper. We hereafter always suppose that $\|R(\lambda, \Lambda_b)\|\leq \frac{1}{\lambda}$ for all $\lambda>0$.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem1}
Assume that the conditions (H1)--(H4) are satisfied. Then the integral system
(1.4) has at least one mild solution on $[0,b]$
for every $\lambda>0$ and $x_b\in X$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
Assume that the conditions (H1), (H2), (H3$'$) and (H4) are satisfied,
then the integral system (1.4) has at least one mild solution
on $[0,b]$.
\end{corollary}
